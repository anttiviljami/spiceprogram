The main purpose of this program is to advance that ideology in our operations. Because it is the right thing to do and will make the world a better place.

Being a company, our motivation, if sincere, is of course not entirely altruistic. We believe that taking the free software movement seriously will help us in recruiting more like-minded people and to keep our own motivated. It could take us towards knowing some of the tools we use more by heart. That would increase efficiency. Hell, we might even get some recognition out of this, if it flies.

But most of all, it is the right thing to do and will help us make the world a better place.
