There has been talk about getting some statistics out regarding our [sponsored open source contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/oss-sponsorship). Since I find both pie charts and the most pies disgusting, I wanted to try something different. A map! Since making one properly (automatic generation, good look and feel, maybe some interaction magic on top of it) sounds like a lot of work, a proof of concept was in order. It's lovingly drawn with the most powerful proprietary tool of them all, MS Paint.

Our developers found it amusing, so we decided to share.
