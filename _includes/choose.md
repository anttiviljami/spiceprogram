Which license to choose?
------------------------

Our advice here applies primarily to software. If you have something else in mind, such as pictures, music or such, please check out the [Creative Commons](/open-source/creative-commons) section.

This may be a good starting point, but you really want to read a bit about the licenses before making any final decisions. Some good resources for that include:

* [GitHub's license choosing site](http://choosealicense.com/)
* [Licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition](http://opensource.org/licenses)
* [Our take on popular licenses](/opensource/licenses)

Here's how we roll:

Can I use this work?
--------------------

It is important to know, if you can use some work. Check out this diagram. Keep in mind that there is no universal rule on "how many lines of code" will constitute a copyright infringement. Could be ten, could be one... The safest bet is to rewrite everything.

If you want to possibly ruin your perfectly good browsing & coffee break, [this copyright discussion on Meta Stack Exchange](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12527/do-i-have-to-worry-about-copyright-issues-for-code-posted-on-stack-overflow) might be of interest. 

Again, as far as the licenses go, this should be pretty solid:
