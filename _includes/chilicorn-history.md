What is the Chilicorn? 
----------------------

It's our [Open Source program's](/) mascot. The program is called Spice Program. Chili is a spice? Get it? Harrr!

Originally I made a version with MS Paint (you can find that below) to put pressure on our designers to create a proper one. Sure enough, [Pekka](http://pekkapulli.com) cracked, and this wondrous thing came to be!

The original

Here's the original MS Paint version:

        <img class="padded-img page-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chilicorn.png" alt="Chilicorn" />

History
-------

Here's how that came to be, summarized in one pic:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <img class="padded-img page-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/photos/chilicorn-birth.png" alt="Our new logo" />
    </div>
</div>

That escalated quickly and in three days we had physical manifestations around the offices:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <img class="padded-img page-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/photos/chilicorn-mug.jpg" alt="Our new logo" />
    </div>
</div>

To conclude this story, here's the unofficial publishing of the new logo:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <img class="padded-img page-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/photos/logo-launch.png" alt="Logo launched" />
    </div>
